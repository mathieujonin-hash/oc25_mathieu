                <img src="parallaxeCemetery.gif" width = 800> <br>
                <p>The first area in the game, a Cemetery where the player "awakens" and learns the first mechanics
                    needed in the game.</p> <br>

                <img src="parallaxeForest.gif" width = 800> <br>
                <p>Another area, the forest where the corrupted elf can be encountered.</p> <br>

                <img src="parallaxeCave.gif" width = 800> <br>
                <p>Another area, the cave... Sounds pretty misterious and looks beautiful right?
                    Well inside you will probably get lost a few times and at the end you will have to fight
                    the Golem.

                    I wanted to mention that they were supposed to be two more areas, a village and a castle,
                    but I didn't have time to do them. The village was an area with a lot of lore and explenations 
                    but also an area to thank everyone that helped me during this project. <br>
                    You can still click <a href="credits.html">here</a> to go to the credit page where everyone is mentionned.
