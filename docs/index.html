                <p> Hi! I'm happy to present my wiki about the game I'm currently working on.
                    It's called <em>Knightmare "A Voice in the Dark"</em> and it's my first game project ever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It started as a school project called “Travail de maturité” (Graduation Project). and since I couldn't finish it completely at the time I only created the 
                    “functional” part of the game. That is, everything the player can do while playing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note that every character, ennemy and NPCs presented in this Wiki are only ideas I wanted to 
                    add in the game. They're not really doing anything for now... 
                </p>
                <p>If you are interested about seeing what every beings I imagined was supposed to look like 
                    feel free to explore this wiki.
                </p><br>
