                <p> HI :), I'm very happy to present you my wiki about the game I'm currently working on.
                    It's called <em>Knightmare "a Voice in the Dark"</em> and it's my first game project ever.
                    It started as a project in school for something called "Travail the Maturité" (in English it would
                    be "Graduation Project") and since I couldn't finish it completely at the time I made only the "working"
                    part of the game. That being all that can be done by the player while playing. <br><br>
                    Please note that every character, ennemy and NPCs presented in this Wiki are only ideas I wanted to 
                    add in the game. They're not really doing anything for now... 
                </p>
                <br><br><br>
                <p>If you are interested about seeing what every beings I imagined was supposed to look like 
                    please click <a href="page1.html">here</a> and for the areas <a href="page2.html">here</a>
                </p>
        
            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            <p>This Wiki and the Game it is related to are still under development</p><br>
