            <p> I would like to thank everyone who participated in any way for this project.<br><br>
                First of all, I wanted to thank Chiara and Sophie for helping me a lot in the decision 
                making for the final forms of the player and the areas.
            </p>
            
            

            <br><p>
                Then, Eliseo and Rayan who helped by lending me their amazing drawing skills. Eliseo made every
                ennemies presented in this wiki and <a href="rayancursed.html">Rayan</a> helped with the backgrounds of the areas wether it was
                to design them or to help drawing them. 
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Thank you everyone that wasn't specifically mentionned for helping with little things such as giving
                your opinion or pointing out some things that didn't work.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                And last but not least, I really wanted to thank Alain Cardinaux for accompanying me throughout
                all this project while it was still under school conditions and for being my tutor.
            </p>
            <br><br>
